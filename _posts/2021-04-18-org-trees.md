title: A better way to visualize your organization - An Org Tree
tags: [ word ]

Companies often represent their organization structure in a hierarchical org chart. These charts start at the top with the President/CEO. From there, they sprawl down and out through the ranks to those doers and newbies at the “bottom” of the org. Charts like this look like a squid.

I am not a fan of drawing things this way. 

An alternative to the hierarchical org chart is the org tree. The org tree flips the org chart upside down. It starts with the President/CEO at the bottom, like the trunk of a tree. From there branches are formed which support smaller and smaller branches. Finally, the leaves represent those at the “top” -  the doers and newbies of the organization.

The tree view tells a powerful organizational story which I like much more:

* Those at the bottom of this org carry weight. They support. They empower. They are experienced anchors in times of change.
* The doers and newbies at the top of the org are valued. They are vital. They are the most supported. 
* We all matter. We all depend on each other.  
* Power and influence come from doing your part really well and supporting more and more people with your work

Which organization would you want to be a part of? Which leader’s vision would you want to follow?
